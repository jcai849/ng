# ng - Note Graph

NB: This may get archived soon - I'm working on a far more interesting and general replacement

## Scope

- [ ] Generating graph of connections between notes
- [ ] Listing notes connected with selected note
  - [ ] Listing notes linked to by selected note
  - [ ] Listing notes backlinking to selected note
  - [ ] External connections (weblinks, etc.)
- [ ] Listing orphan notes
- [ ] Listing placeholder notes
- [ ] Listing tags
- [ ] Listing files holding tag
- [ ] Note rename transforming note backlinks

Better terminology is well-defined in a graph-theoretic context and should be used instead

## Means

1. Parse markdown (using something like [md4c](https://github.com/mity/md4c))
2. Map connections as a graph (something like [cgraph][https://graphviz.org/docs/library/])
3. Output relevant lists
